# Hi there! 👋 I'm Octavio
😄 **Pronouns:** He/Him/His

🏫 **Education:** I completed my undergraduate studies at the **Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)**, where I received degrees in:
  - Mathematics 🧮 (S.B.)
  - Physics 🔭 (S.B.)
    
  I also minored in **Public Policy** (Security & Defense Studies, specifically).

## 📓 **Research Interests**: Lattice Gauge Theory, Quantum Chromodynamics
🖥️ I’m currently working on applying deep generative models to accelerating the pipeline of lattice quantum field theory simulations. In particular, normalizing flows and diffusion.

🧪 Lately, I've been experimenting with extending score-based diffusion models to sampling gauge configurations on the lattice
