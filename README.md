## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Octavio
ðŸ˜„ **Pronouns:** He/Him/His

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on applying deep generative models to accelerating the pipeline of lattice quantum field theory simulations. In particular, normalizing flows and diffusion.

ðŸ““ I completed my undergraduate studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where I received bachelor of science degrees in both Mathematics and Physics. I also minored in Public Policy and obtained a concentration in German.
